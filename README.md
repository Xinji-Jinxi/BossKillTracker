# Boss Kill Tracker

# Overview
The Boss Kill Tracker addon allows players to track the number of times they’ve killed specific dungeon and raid bosses in World of Warcraft. It supports all classic and Turtle WoW dungeon and raid bosses. World bosses have unfortunately not been included. This may be included at a later date if there is a significant demand for it.

# Features
- Tracks kill counts for bosses in dungeons, raids, and custom content.
- Logs each boss kill in the chat with the total kill count.
- Allows players to query the kill count of any tracked boss using in-game commands.

# In-Game Commands

The following in-game command displays the total number of times the specified boss has been killed.
* /tbk < Boss Name >
* /TotalBossKill < Boss Name >

# Notes
If no input is provided or the boss name is unrecognized, an error message will be displayed.
All tracked bosses are predefined and include all major dungeon, raid, and custom bosses.

# Installation
- Extract the addon to your WoW "Interface/AddOns/" directory.
- Remove the '-main' part from the folder name.
- Enable the addon in the game’s AddOns menu.
- Reload your UI or restart the game to begin tracking!
